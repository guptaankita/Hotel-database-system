				that match his requirement from a huge database that contains
				information about a wide range of hotels and then book a hotel of
				his choice. Objective of the application are as follows: <br>
				1.Application through which customers have access to a hotel
				database and can book and review hotels. <br> 2.Application
				will be intuitive to use and easy-to-maintain. <br>

				3.Application will be able to handle simultaneous requests from

			<td>Implementation</td>
			<td>We have queried a web service by invoking it through its
				given API. Passing the required parameters & the hotel search
				results data was transmitted back in either XML or JSON format. We
				have set the output type to JSON. We have passed the JSON data
				extracting only those attributes which are useful for the project.
				We have implemented the web application in Eclipse IDE using JSF
				framework, it is a Java specification for building component-based
				user interfaces for web applications. Thus our front end web pages
				being developed in JSP pages, our business tier logic was
				implemented using Java. We have thus cleanly separated our Client
				layer, Presentation & Business Tier. We have used an open source
				MySQL(5.1) for storing our data. We have used Navicat tool UI tool
				for interacting with the database.</td>

			<td>Conclusion</td>
			<td>We did not maintain a local data dump & dynamically
				retrieved the hotel search results using the API. We have
				implemented hotel booking, reviews, Login management & administrator
				functions. Thus covering most aspects of our initial objectives &
				meeting the requirements set by the course. Further work is to
				professionally develop the website & host the website!</td>
